# Simon says
The Simon Says game is a memory challenge that tests your ability to remember and repeat sequences of colors. Each round, a new color is added to the sequence, making it longer and more complex. The objective is to click the colors in the exact order shown, and if the player makes a mistake, the game ends, and their score is displayed. The game is designed to be fun and engaging, putting your memory and recall abilities to the test.
